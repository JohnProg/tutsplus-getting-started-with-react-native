## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]

When building mobile applications, you might not always want to go native, if you have to develop your app for different platforms. But creating a web application will lack performance and some times even features native apps just have. React Native, created by Facebook, tries to bridge this gap, by giving you the possibility to write your user interface in modern JavaScript and automatically transform it into native views specific to your supported platforms.

In this course, Markus Mühlberger will give you an introduction to writing mobile applications in React Native. You will learn how to create, layout and style components, provide user interaction and also fetch data from the internet.
